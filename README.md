# Project_2A - Posties

This is a simple blog app which allows users to view, create, edit and delete blog posts. Blog posts have a title and body (of content). 

The app is found here: [Posties](https://intense-river-14194.herokuapp.com/)

###Technology
The technology used include:

- Ruby on Rails (ruby 2.3.0p0, rails 4.2.5);
- Boostrap 3.3;
- Postgres (in production), sqlite3 (development, test)

Development was done on the Cloud9 web platform.
User acceptance testing was done using Rspec.
Version controlled on Github.
Continuous Integration with Travis. 
Auto-deployment on Heroku.

###How it works

By default, users are shown a list of all blog posts, and are able to view them individually.

Users can create their own accounts through 'Sign Up' functionality. When logging into their accounts, they are then able to create, edit and destroy blog posts.
