# Project_2A - Posties

This is a simple blog app which allows users to view, create, edit and delete blog posts. Blog posts have a title and body (of content). 

The development is done in a test-driven manner based on test files provided in the 'spec' folder.

The app is currently hosted on the Heroku platform: [Posties](https://intense-river-14194.herokuapp.com/)

###Technology
The technology used include:

- Ruby on Rails (ruby 2.3.0p0, rails 4.2.5);
- Boostrap 3.3;
- Postgres (in production);

The development was done on Cloud9 platform using sqlite3 database. 


###How it works

By default, users are shown a list of all blog posts, and are able to view them individually.

Users can create their own accounts through 'Sign Up' functionality. When logging into their accounts, they are then able to create, edit and destroy blog posts.
